My personal website

## Welcome to my repository for my website on GitHub!

Hello, my name is Jeremy Lesmana and I'm using GitHub to host my personal website. I figure that it's too cheap to buy a hosting
service costing around $35-$50 a year when I can just get it for free, thanks to GitHub. It won't be a problem anyways since my
website is composed of HTML, CSS, and jQuery; therefore everything should be static and working fine. I'm probably planning
to redirect one of my domains that I own, jeremylesmana.com, to redirect itself to this GitHub repository.

Well, hopefully you find this repository helpful in someways.
Thanks,
Jeremy
