                        The JPL invention challenge is a competition held annually hosted by NASA.
                        The competition is designed for teams of students to compete against other
                        teams in local schools. Every year students are instructed to design a mechanism
                        to perform a certain task, and the team with the most efficient and effective
                        way to perform that task with their mechanism wins. There will be a referee on
                        the spot to start and stop a stopwatch and judge our results. There will also be
                        other judges and staff members inspecting and judging our mechanisms.

                        For our school, we will hold an intramural competition amongst the different
                        Advanced CAD classes. The top 3 teams with the fastest time will be qualified to
                        proceed to the JPL competition and have a chance to win first place in the
                        competition.

                        Our mission this year for the JPL invention challenge is to design a
                        mechanism that can transport 250 grams of water from a plastic cup to a water
                        vessel 2 meters away. The team with the fastest time and least spillage wins the
                        competition. There will also be a plastic fish placed in the first cup that has to
                        be safely transferred as well. The mechanism must be switched by a one-time
                        trigger such as buttons, levers, cutting a string, etc... and from then on the
                        machine must perform its actions by itself.
